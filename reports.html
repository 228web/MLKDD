								<h2>4/27 Meeting Report</h2>
							</header>

							<p>
								Here are the main points discussed at our meeting:
							</p>

							<ul class="default">
								<li>
									As time complexity was a big concern for feature engineering,
									we knew we had to come up with ways to filter our data to be smaller.
								</li>
								<li>
									Initially there were many ideas on how to design appropriate filters:<br />
									<ol class="default">
										<li>Finding the strongest and weakest students and filtering out the average ones.</li>
										<li>Calculating the average duration time to see if we could eliminate the some samples based on that.</li>
										<li>
											Engineering unique problems ("ProblemHierarchy;ProblemName") to calculate the total numer of views
											for each problem so we can analyze that and remove some unique problems based on their view counts.
										</li>
									</ol>
								</li>
								<li>
									After data engineering, we reasearched and thought about an appropriate ratio to create new train,
									validation and test sets based of the original dataset.
								</li>
								<li>
									Next, our team considered the the most appropriate methods to be used in Phase 2.
									We predicted and then realized even after filtering the initial data, the size of the new dataset
									would still be very large for us in order to experiment with machine learning methods that require
									comprehensive feature engineering. KNN algorithm was our based option to experiment with before progress report deadline.
								</li>
							</ul>

							<p>
								<b>Note:</b> The above points were the primarily topics we discussed in our weekly meeting.
								Afterwards, our team members have been constantly communicating with each other on our
								<a href="https://slack.com/">Slack</a> team page to further discuss about details of each point, new ideas, etc.

								<h2>4/19 Revised Meeting with Prof. Ding</h2>
							</header>

							<h3>Hello Professor Ding,</h3>

							<p>
								<br />
								Thank you for taking the time and giving us feedback on our Phase 1 report.
								The followings are the main points of what we discussed today.
							</p>

							<ul class="default">
								<li>
									Our phase1 report shows our team's hard work and it is well organized but lacks any indication that we deeply
									understand the methods we used and specifically why we used those techniques.
								</li>
								<li>
									For final phase, we are free to create our own data and test sets in any suitable way.
								</li>
								<li>
									It is suggested that we should pick one or two methods and focus on them instead of working on many methods at the same time.
								</li>
								<li>
									A progress report is needed for phase2 and that progress report is a webpage that we create to publish our project
									report with main sections that describe / include:
									<br />
									<br />
									<ol class="default">
										<li>
											Why is our topic a good machine learning project?
										</li>
										<li>
											Methods used with reasonings
										</li>
										<li>
											Experiments we have done
										</li>
										<li>
											Overall design
										</li>
										<li>
											Source code
										</li>
										<li>
											Datasets
										</li>
									</ol>
								</li>
								<li>
									The project website can be used to showcase some of our skills in machine learning /
									data analysis if we would like to work in a related field at a company.
								</li>
								<li>
									Our final presentation will be on May 19th and it should take no more than 30 minutes.
								</li>
							</ul>
